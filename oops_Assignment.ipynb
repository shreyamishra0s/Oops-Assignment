        "Polymorphism promotes code reuse by enabling the creation of generic code that can operate on objects of various types, as long as they share a common interface or base class.\n",

        "It enhances readability by allowing programmers to focus on the common behavior defined in a parent class or interface, rather than needing to manage numerous special cases for each specific type.\n",
        "3. Extensibility and Maintainability:\n",
        "Polymorphism facilitates the extension of software systems by allowing new classes to be easily integrated into existing frameworks.\n",
        "It improves maintainability by centralizing shared functionality in parent classes, meaning updates to that functionality only need to be made in one place.\n",

        "= Multiple inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes, combining their attributes and methods into a single derived class. This enables a class to acquire features from several distinct sources, promoting code reuse and modularity.\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "Syntax: To implement multiple inheritance, a child class lists multiple parent classes within its definition, separated by commas.Method Resolution Order (MRO): When a method is called on an object of a class with multiple inheritance, Python follows a specific order to search for the method in the inheritance hierarchy. This order is known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO). Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, which ensures a consistent and predictable resolution order, even in complex inheritance scenarios (like the \"diamond problem\"). The MRO can be inspected using the .__mro__ attribute or the .mro() method of a class.super() function: The super() function can be used in the derived class to call methods of the parent classes, respecting the MRO. This is particularly useful when overriding methods and needing to invoke the parent's implementation.\n",
        "Considerations:\n",
        "While powerful, multiple inheritance can introduce complexity if not managed carefully. Understanding the MRO is crucial to avoid unexpected behavior when methods with the same name exist in different parent classes."
